## Introduction

A desktop app that provides real-time visualization and allows users to load and visualize signal files (e.g., ECG, EEG), built with PyQt.

## Live Demo

## Features

- **Multi Channel**: You can browse your PC to open multiple signal files in more than one port.

- **Linking Graphs**: The application contains two main identical graphs, where you can control each one of them by his controls, you can also link the two graphs with one controller.

- **Cine Mode**: Signals are displayed in cine mode, similar to ICU monitors. You can rewind a signal if it ends.

- **Signal Controls**: The user can change color, add labels, show/hide, customize cine speed, zoom in/out, pause/play/rewind, and scroll/pan the signal in any direction.

- **Signal Transfer**: You can move signals from one graph to the other.

- **Glue Signals**: Where you can crop important parts of the two signals, and glut them with different interpolation methods, for better understanding of the signals.

- **Radar Viewer**: you can upload any signal and show it on the radar viewer where you can get a better view of the signal features that can't be seen in the normal graph.

- **Radar Controllers**: The user can pause/play/rewind, and customize cine speed of the radar.

- **Exporting & Reporting**: You can generate a report with snapshots of the  two graphs, and the Glue graph, with showing of the data statistics on the displayed signals, exported to a PDF file. The report includes mean, standard deviation, duration, minimum, and maximum values for each signal.
